# Magic Square Kata in F#

##When?

This is from TFL CT Kata Club on 27/07/2016.

##What?

It's a basic implimentation of a 3x3 Magic Square checker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square). It will only work on 3x3 squares at present as the row value has been hard coded.

Look in [Program.fs](MagicSquareKata/Program.fs) as this is where action is.

##Why?

It was written in F# as I fancied a go at a functional language and the problem is pretty easy.
