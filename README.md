# Magic Square Kata in F&#35;

## When?

This is from Kata Club on 27/07/2016.

## What?

It's a basic implimentation of a 3x3 Magic Square checker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square).

Look in [Program.fs](MagicSquareKata/Program.fs) as this is where action is.

## Why?

It was written in F# as I fancied a go at a functional language and the problem is pretty easy.
